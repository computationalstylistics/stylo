TO DO:


GEPHI support is still very rough

culling could be easily implemented as a separate function

make.final.ranking --> should be a extracted as a separate function


only one file in the II set should be allowed

openNLP





functionalities not implemented in classify:
interactive.files <<- FALSE
use.custom.list.of.files <<- TRUE


man pages: keywords to be re-considered




Christof: a loop for different start.at values
Fotis: custom list of files does not work for sample labels
Peter: an external list of words: similar approach as for custom.files




applicable scenarios:
 
1. MDS, 100, En, pdf, png
2. MDS, 1000, 100% culling, En, pdf, png
3. PCA, corr., 100
4. Cons.Tree
...

what about a disclaimer on the last tab? Something containing names of authors,
bibliogr. ref., concise description, links to on-line manuals, CSG logo, ...


common wordlist when the number of full-sized novels >100
(picking the first 100 by chance? extracting randomly 1M words?,
extract a number of words, say 50k, from each novel?)

dendrograms: ward, complete, average, nj
rooted consensus trees?

the code for MDS and PCA in different flavors deserves some comments!
